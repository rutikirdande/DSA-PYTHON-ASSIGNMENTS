    "# 1.Word embeddings capture semantic meaning by representing words as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, where similar words are placed closer to each other. These embeddings are learned from large text corpora using techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe, which consider the context of words in sentences. By capturing word co-occurrence patterns, embeddings can capture semantic relationships and similarities between words.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 3.The encoder-decoder concept is used in tasks like machine translation or text summarization. The encoder takes an input sequence (e.g., a sentence) and maps it to a fixed-length representation called the context vector. The decoder then uses this context vector to generate the target sequence (e.g., translated sentence or summary).
